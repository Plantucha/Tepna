**Status:** IN-PROGRESS — 2026-07-03 (CPAPDex pass) · **Decisions:** D1 = **shared helper** (`dexScrubExport` in `dex-export.js`; OxyDex's node-local `oxyScrubExport` folds in on its next re-bundle) · D2 = **defer** Tier-3 (PpgDex/HRVDex lean-vs-enrich decided in their own passes) · **Created:** 2026-07-03 · **Executed-residue-of:** `SELF-INGEST-2026-06-27-BRIEF.md` (DONE 2026-07-02, pilot OxyDex) · **Prerequisite:** the OxyDex pilot pattern (`oxyLoadOwnExport` / `oxyScrubExport` + review-mode render/clinical-print/scrub, `oxydex-dsp.js` / `oxydex-render.js` / `oxydex-app.js`)

# Self-ingest roll-out — `loadOwnExport` clinical summary for the other six nodes

> **One-line:** The OxyDex pilot proved the pattern (drop a node's OWN `ganglior.node-export` back in →
> faithful, print/PDF **clinical summary** in review mode; no recompute, no re-stamp; raw panels greyed;
> foreign-node guard; scrub-for-sharing). Roll it to the remaining six — **one node per pass, each
> re-bundle + gate-gated** — but NOT as a blind copy: execution of the pilot surfaced that **two nodes'
> exports don't carry a per-element derived layer at all**, so they need a decision, not a mechanical port.

> **⏳ CPAPDex pass — IN-PROGRESS checkpoint (2026-07-03) · RESUME HERE.**
> **Code landed (external JS only — `CPAPDex.src.html` NOT touched, so `buildHash` stays; `manifestHash` moves):**
> - `dex-export.js` — shared `scrubExport` (D1), exposed as `DexExport.scrubExport` + bare `dexScrubExport`.
> - `cpapdex-fusion.js` — `cpapLoadOwnExport(json)` (detect · guard `schema.node==='CPAPDex'` · unwrap `nights[]` \| single-obj · gather+sort events · mark `_fromExport`/`_reviewMode`; NEVER `.stamp()`), on `CpapFusion`.
> - `cpapdex-render.js` — `renderReviewView` + `cpapReviewBanner`/`cpapClinicalSummary`/`cpapEventTimeline`/`cpapGreyedPanel`/`injectSelfIngestCSS`, on `CpapRender`. Clinical card reads the export element's stored fields DIRECTLY (no night reconstruction — CPAPDex has no summary→night path unlike OxyDex's `parseJSONL`); greys raw flow/pressure/leak; `@media print` isolates `.cpap-clinical`.
> - `cpapdex-app.js` — `handleFileList` routes a CPAPDex own-export → `cpapLoadOwnExport` → `window._cpapReview` → `renderReview()`; OxyDex/ECGDex still → `CpapCoimport`. `exportNight()` review branch stamps `schema.derivedFrom` (+ optional scrub); normal path also honors scrub. Reset + `renderResults` clear review. Scrub checkbox injected into `#exportBar` (`window._cpapScrub`).
>
> **Remaining (todos 8–11):**
> 1. **Tests** — add a `Self-ingest (CPAPDex)` group to `tests/dex-tests.js` (BOTH runners), placed after the OxyDex §7 group. Source: `env.CPAPDex.compute({edfSets:[env.CpapDsp._synthEdfSet({oxi:true,cs:true})]})` → `env.CpapFusion.cpapLoadOwnExport`. Reach scrub via **`env.DexExport.scrubExport`** (env exposes `DexExport`/`CPAPDex`/`CpapFusion`/`CpapDsp` in both runners; there is **no** `env.dexScrubExport`). Source-text for the no-restamp assert: `env.sources['cpapdex-fusion.js']`. Mirror OxyDex §7: round-trip · faithful-view (element==export) · provenance-no-restamp (strip comments, assert no `.stamp(`/`GangliorProvenance`) · review-not-faked (`_fromExport`) · foreign-node guard (ECGDex → message names source + Integrator) · scrub.
> 2. **Re-bundle** `CPAPDex.html` from `CPAPDex.src.html`; let it settle; **re-read** the new `manifestHash`.
> 3. **GATE A** — set CPAPDex's `BUILD-MANIFEST.json` entry to the new `manifestHash`.
> 4. **GATE B** — CPAPDex fixtures are **EXPORT-INERT** (scrub opt-in; goldens built without scrub; reload doesn't change emit) → re-record `manifestHash` ONLY for CPAPDex fixtures in `FIXTURE-PROVENANCE.json`; do NOT regenerate.
> 5. **⚠ shared-file blast radius** — `dex-export.js` is bundled into all 8 apps; editing it MAY auto-rebuild others → their `manifestHash` may drift. After the build settles, re-read `verify-provenance.html`; if other nodes moved, re-record them too (still export-inert — `scrubExport` is behavior-inert for non-callers). Per CLAUDE.md: if GATE A/B already reconcile, do NOT hand-edit (concurrent-writer rule).
> 6. **Gates** — `Dex-Test-Suite.html?full` all-green (new group + `env.equiv.cpapdex_golden` + multinight golden must stay green — they SHOULD, emit unchanged) + `verify-provenance.html` GATE A/B clean.
> 7. **Sync** `DOCS-INDEX.md` + flip this brief to `Status: DONE — <date>` for the CPAPDex pass, then start the next node (order: PulseDex next).
>
> **Gotchas:** carrier = `nights[]` (multi) or the object itself (single; detect `recording && (metrics||oximetry)`); event impulses = `apnea/hypopnea/rera/periodic_breathing/desat_event/large_leak`; the review view renders the export element directly (never rebuilt into a night).

## 0. What the pilot proved — and the carrier reality it exposed (verify, don't trust)

The pilot brief §1/§6 *assumed* every node-export carries a per-element summary array
(`recordings[]` for ECGDex/PulseDex, `sessions[]` for PpgDex). **That is only partly true — confirmed by
reading the builders 2026-07-03.** The self-ingest clinical view is only as rich as what the export
actually stores, so the roll-out splits into three feasibility tiers:

| Node | Export carrier (the array/obj to unwrap) | Builder | Derived layer in the export | Feasibility |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **OxyDex** ✅ | `nights[]` (single = obj) | `oxyBuildNightElement` | **rich** per-night summary | **DONE (pilot)** |
| **PulseDex** | `recordings[]` (`pulsedex-app.js:642`) | `pdBuildNodeExport` | **rich** per-recording (`lastResult` shape) | **Tier 1 — mechanical** |
| **CPAPDex** | `nights[]` (`cpapdex-fusion.js:257`) | `cpapBuildExport` | **rich** per-night | **Tier 1 — mechanical** |
| **GlucoDex** | single recording obj | `glucodex-app.js` (~794; confirm a shared `glucoBuildNodeExport` was extracted) | **rich** (glucose stats · patterns · `timeseries.cells`+`agpHourly`+`perDay`) | **Tier 2 — single-record** |
| **ECGDex** | single obj / `recordings[]` (multi) | `ecgBuildNodeExport` (`ecgdex-dsp.js:1867`) | rich **only under `opts.rich`** (`hrv.time` · `frequency` · `timeseries.epochs` · `morphology` · `sleepStages`) — the light stream is events-heavy | **Tier 2 — confirm rich-mode** |
| **PpgDex** | **single obj — NO carrier** (`ppgdex-dsp.js:1015`: `{ schema, recording, ganglior_events, reserved }`) | `ppgBuildNodeExport` | **event-only + `recording` meta** — no per-session summary | **Tier 3 — needs a decision** |
| **HRVDex** | **single obj — NO carrier** (`hrvdex-dsp.js:~795`: `recording.measurements:N` + events, no per-measurement rows) | `hrvBuildNodeExport` | **event-only + aggregate** — the per-day SDNN/rMSSD table is NOT in the export | **Tier 3 — needs a decision** |

**Why Tier 3 is not a port.** OxyDex self-ingest works because `nights[]` carries the full per-night
summary — the review renderer shows stored values verbatim. **PpgDex and HRVDex exports carry only
`ganglior_events[]` + aggregate `recording` metadata**, so a "faithful clinical summary" for them can
show the event timeline + span/coverage aggregates and *nothing else* — no per-metric KPI cards, no
findings table — unless their export shape is first enriched to carry a per-element summary. That
enrichment **MOVES fixture bytes** (it changes the emit shape), so unlike the pilot (which was
export-inert re-ingest only) it triggers the FULL per-node fixture regenerate + re-record ritual.

### 0.1 Decisions to make BEFORE touching code (record the answer in this header when settled)
- **D1 — scrub: shared helper vs per-node duplicate.** `oxyScrubExport` is already near node-agnostic
  (it operates on `schema.provenance.inputs[]` + `recording.{device,serial,model}`, keeps a coarse
  build stamp + `contentId`). Either lift it to ONE shared `dexScrubExport(envelope)` (each node's app
  calls it) **or** duplicate per node in the `parseTimestamp` house tradition (CLAUDE.md leans
  duplicate for parser-class utils — but scrub is not a parser and is genuinely identical across nodes).
  Recommendation: **one shared helper** in a small existing shared module; decide and note it.
- **D2 — Tier 3 (PpgDex/HRVDex): accept-lean vs enrich-first.** Either **(a)** ship a lean review view
  (event timeline + aggregates + the honest "this export carries no per-metric summary" note) —
  **export-inert, cheap**; or **(b)** enrich `ppgBuildNodeExport` / `hrvBuildNodeExport` to carry a
  per-element summary array FIRST (fixture-moving — full regenerate + re-record + re-bundle), then the
  clinical view is as rich as the others. Pick per node; (a) is a fine v1 that (b) can supersede later.
- **D3 — reconstruction reuse.** The pilot reused OxyDex's existing `parseJSONL` (summary-element →
  renderable night). Each node needs a summary→renderable path. **Confirm per node** whether one
  already exists (PulseDex/HRVDex have foreign-JSON ingest paths to extend; HRVDex's ECGDex-JSON ingest
  is at `hrvdex-dsp.js:318`); if none, the review renderer reads the export element's stored fields
  directly (no recompute).

---

## 1. The generic contract (node-agnostic — recap of the pilot, do NOT re-derive)

Every node's `loadOwnExport(json)` is the SAME shape the pilot shipped; only the carrier key + the
per-element reconstruction + which panels are raw-only + the clinical KPI set are node-specific.

1. **Detect** — `json && json.schema && json.schema.name === 'ganglior.node-export'`.
2. **Guard own kind** — `json.schema.node === <ThisNode>`; a foreign export is **rejected with a
   redirect message** (`"This is an <X> export — open it in <X>, or drop it into the Integrator to
   fuse."`), never coerced. (Mirror `oxyLoadOwnExport`'s message.)
3. **Unwrap** — read the node's carrier (table §0); a single-record export is the object itself.
4. **Reconstruct** the derived layer via the node's existing summary→render path (D3) — **no recompute
   beyond a deterministic stored-scalar re-derive that reproduces the stored value**; prefer the stored
   value, treat divergence as a review-mode bug (never silently shown).
5. **Mark `reviewMode`** (`_fromExport`/`_reviewMode` per element) + return `provenance`/`generated`/
   `derivedFrom`/`kernel`/`crossNight`/`events`/`scrubbed` **verbatim**.
6. **Never** call `GangliorProvenance.stamp()` on this path (that stamps the current build over the
   original). A review-mode **re-export writes `schema.derivedFrom`** (original buildHash + `via`).
7. **Expose on the namespace** (`<Node>.loadOwnExport`, `<Node>.scrubExport`) AND in the shared
   `Object.assign(global, {...})` export list so **both runners** reach the same functions.

The render side is likewise a recap: inject the self-ingest CSS from the external JS (not the shell),
gate on `window._<node>Review` **and** every loaded element `_fromExport`, lead with the review banner +
clinical summary (findings → badged KPIs → event timeline → provenance → intended-use disclaimer +
`dxl-` stamp), grey (never fake) any panel that needs raw samples, and `@media print` isolate the
clinical card. Reuse OxyDex's `oxyClinicalSummary`/`oxyReviewBanner`/`oxyEventTimeline`/`oxyGreyedPanel`
as the reference implementations — port their structure, swap the node's KPI/raw-panel specifics.

---

## 2. Per-node execution notes (the node-specific labor)

**PulseDex (Tier 1).** Carrier `recordings[]` (each a `lastResult`-shaped rich summary). Raw-only →
grey the **RR tachogram** + **Poincaré scatter** (per-beat). Extend PulseDex's file-drop/compare import
to detect the envelope; reconstruct via the summary→render path (confirm D3). Clinical KPIs: rMSSD,
SDNN, mean RR/HR, SD1/SD2, coverage. Export-inert → re-record only.

**CPAPDex (Tier 1).** Carrier `nights[]` (`cpapBuildExport`). Raw-only → grey per-session **pressure /
leak / flow** curves. KPIs: residual AHI, therapy hours, central/obstructive/hypopnea index, median
leak, periodic-breathing %. The `env.equiv`/CPAPDex synthetic goldens already pin
`compute() ≡ cpapBuildExport`, so keep the reload path off the emit builder. Export-inert → re-record.

**GlucoDex (Tier 2).** Single recording obj; **rich** — `glucose` stats + `patterns` + decimated
`timeseries.cells` + `agpHourly` + `perDay` all travel, so most of the dashboard renders from the
export. Raw-only → grey only the full-resolution per-reading trace (the AGP renders from the carried
decimation — label it "from export decimation", don't fake full-res). Confirm the node-export builder
was extracted to a DSP `glucoBuildNodeExport` (SIGNAL-ADAPTER-PHASE9) before wiring; if still in
`glucodex-app.js`, the reload path must not re-enter DOM. KPIs: mean glucose/GMI, CV, TIR, MODD/ADRR,
dawn Δ. Export-inert → re-record.

**ECGDex (Tier 2).** Single obj / `recordings[]` (multi). Rich derived layer exists **only under
`opts.rich`** — first confirm what `ecgdex-app.js` emits by default; if the shipped export is the light
(events-heavy) stream, the clinical view is timeline-led (like Tier 3) unless rich is the default or
opt-in. Raw-only → grey the **ECG waveform** + **per-beat morphology**. KPIs: mean/min/max HR, SDNN/
rMSSD (if rich), AF burden / ectopy counts, sleep-stage minutes (if rich). Note: `ecgBuildNodeExport`
strips the internal `_sec` — the reload must not expect it.

**PpgDex (Tier 3 — D2).** Export is `{ schema, recording, ganglior_events, reserved }` — **no per-
session summary**. Path (a): lean review = event timeline + `recording` aggregates + an honest "no
per-metric summary in this export" panel. Path (b): enrich `ppgBuildNodeExport` with a `sessions[]` (or
single-summary) carrier FIRST → fixture-moving, full regenerate + re-record + re-bundle. Raw-only under
(a): nearly everything (optical waveform, LED-agreement ribbon, Poincaré).

**HRVDex (Tier 3 — D2).** Export carries `recording.measurements:N` + `ganglior_events[]` but **NOT the
per-measurement SDNN/rMSSD/MeanRR/pNN50 table** — that is the whole clinical value, so path (a) is very
lean here. Strongly consider path (b): enrich `hrvBuildNodeExport` to carry the per-measurement rows
(fixture-moving). HRVDex already has a foreign ECGDex-JSON ingest at `hrvdex-dsp.js:318` — extend the
same drop path to detect + route its OWN `node:"HRVDex"` envelope. Watch the Baevsky ms-vs-s guard and
the `meta.derived`/heuristic tier on the vendor black-box composites — **no tier upgrade on reload**.

---

## 3. Ordering (one node per pass — never batch re-bundles; §🔏)

Recommended sequence, easiest structural twin of the pilot first:
**CPAPDex → PulseDex → GlucoDex → ECGDex → [D2 gate] → HRVDex → PpgDex.**
Land each fully (code → §7 tests → re-bundle → both gates) before starting the next. The first two are
`nights[]`/`recordings[]` twins of OxyDex and should be near-mechanical; they de-risk the shared render
port. Do the two Tier-3 nodes last, after D2 is decided.

## 4. Tests (mirror the pilot's §7 group per node, both runners)

Clone the OxyDex `Self-ingest — loadOwnExport clinical reload` group (`tests/dex-tests.js`) per node,
driven off that node's `compute()` + `loadOwnExport()` on the node's deterministic synthetic input:
round-trip · faithful-view (reconstructed == stored, no drift) · provenance preserved (no `.stamp(`,
no `GangliorProvenance` in the reload CODE — strip comments before asserting) · tier preserved (no
upgrade) · review-mode not faked (`_fromExport` set, no fabricated series) · foreign-node guard · scrub.
For Tier-3 nodes under path (a), the faithful-view leg asserts events+aggregates only (and that the "no
per-metric summary" note is emitted, not a fabricated table). Wire the node's `<NODE>_REGISTRY` +
resolver + reference-guide text into `env` in BOTH runners if the clinical view badges new surfaces.

## 5. Gates + re-bundle ritual (per node)

- **Reload-only (Tier 1/2, path (a)):** touches external JS only → re-bundle that node, `manifestHash`
  moves, hand-update its `BUILD-MANIFEST.json` entry (GATE A). **Export shape unchanged ⇒ EXPORT-INERT**
  → re-record that node's fixtures' `manifestHash` in `FIXTURE-PROVENANCE.json`, do **NOT** regenerate.
- **Enrich-first (Tier 3, path (b)):** the emit shape changes ⇒ **fixtures move** → re-run the app on
  its committed inputs, re-export, re-record `{ manifestHash, inputHashes, outputHash }`, and expect the
  node's `env.equiv` leg to red until regenerated (that's GATE C doing its job).
- Every pass: `Dex-Test-Suite.html?full` all-green (incl. the new §7 group + the node's equiv leg);
  `verify-provenance.html` GATE A/B clean. **Record `manifestHash` only AFTER the build settles, then
  re-read before trusting** (PROVENANCE-NONDETERMINISM §2/§4 — the platform may auto-rebuild). Keep
  `DOCS-INDEX.md` in sync as each node flips.

## 6. Done when
- [ ] Each of the six nodes re-ingests its OWN v2.0 envelope into a **review-mode** clinical view (raw
      panels greyed, never faked); a foreign export is rejected with a redirect message.
- [ ] **No recompute / no badge upgrade / no `buildHash` re-stamp** on any node's reload; review-mode
      re-export stamps `schema.derivedFrom`.
- [ ] **D1** (scrub shared vs duplicate) and **D2** (Tier-3 lean vs enrich, per node) are decided and
      recorded in this header; scrub strips serials/filenames/sha256 while keeping `contentId` + coarse
      stamp + summary on every node that gains it.
- [ ] `Dex-Test-Suite.html?full` green (a §7 group per node) + `verify-provenance.html` GATE A/B clean
      after each node's re-bundle; ledgers re-recorded (or regenerated for any Tier-3 path (b)).
- [ ] One node per pass; `DOCS-INDEX.md` status kept in sync.

## 7. Follow-ups / linked work
- **`EXPORT-IDENTITY` alignment** — the scrub toggle pivots on `recording.contentId`; a node only keeps
  it through scrub if it emits it. Coordinate with `EXPORT-IDENTITY-FOLLOWUPS` so the scrubbed clinical
  copy stays matchable without a device serial.
- **`EVENT-LEXICON`** — the clinical event timeline renders `ganglior_events[].impulse`; keep each
  node's timeline labels + evidence-badge mapping consistent with the canonical vocabulary.
- **Integrator review-mode** — "load my fused export as a read-only clinical summary" is the multi-node
  analog (the Integrator already ingests exports for fusion). Out of scope here; note as a future idea.
- **Tier-3 enrichment as its own brief** — if D2 picks path (b) for PpgDex/HRVDex, that export-shape
  change is meaty enough to spin into a dedicated `-ENRICH` brief per node rather than riding this one.
