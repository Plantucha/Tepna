The 3 failures share ONE identified cause, and it **CONFIRMS §7's dilution hypothesis**: ρ_motion (0.04–0.39) fell short of the ρ the geometry needs (0.59–0.69), so `threeCorneredHat` fell through the `correlated-external` branch into the boundary-seeking min-ρ search, which pins the quiet corner at ≈0 **by construction**.

## 0. State recap — what shipped (do NOT redo)
- **HR-hat** (ECG+PPG+Oxy) + **external-ρ from cross-node motion** (`_tchHat`/`_tchRhoFromMotion`, FU-I §1/§2).
- **Absolute-wall-clock alignment** (`_epKey`, FU-II §1 — the correctness keystone; staggered-start gate `5f`).
- **τ-curve Allan-deviation sparkline** (FU-I §3) + **`block.tchHR` render card** (FU-II §3).
- **Quiet-sensor order caveat** (`quietOrderUncertain`/`quietSensors`, FU-II §5, gate `5g`).
- **The golden** (FU-II §2): three deterministic staggered node-exports rebuilt in-code → real
  `adaptEnvelopeNode`+`fuseHRVConsensus` → deep-diffed by the `equivalence gate` in both runners; GATE-B
  code-gated. Generator harness `_diag/tch-golden-gen.html`.

## §1 — real-data ρ validation (FU-II §4) — ✅ EXECUTED / CLOSED 2026-07-13 (docs §11)

> still 0.24 → motion 1.39 bpm). **REMAINING (still owed):** the end-to-end A/B — run these nights' node
> exports through the Integrator's own `_tchHat`/`fuseHRVConsensus` with ρ on vs off and confirm ρ *reduces*
> recovered divergence vs classic. **PARTLY EXECUTED 2026-07-07 (write-up §5):** the A/B was run through the
Integrator's OWN `threeCorneredHat` on the committed 5-night trio (30-s epoch-binned) — the shipped fusion
code reproduces classic σ recovery + the 06-13 negative-variance regime, closing the "never run through the
Integrator's own code" gap. But a FIXED external ρ=0.44 does NOT reduce divergence — it over-subtracts (Σσ²
rises on every solvable night; the solve fails on the highest-agreement night), empirically confirming the ρ
must be PER-NIGHT motion-derived (`_tchRhoFromMotion`), not a constant. **STILL OWED:** the per-night-motion-ρ
verdict needs committed per-node motion (O2Ring `Motion` is committed; H10/Verity accel are not).
**UPDATE 2026-07-07 (write-up §6):** a **faithful per-night motion-ρ run** was executed end-to-end through the
shipped `threeCorneredHat` on real user-provided node exports for **2026-07-06**. **First pass** (raw O2Ring
`Motion` ↔ Verity `motionIndex`, r=0.585→ρ=0.585) was a positive-variance night — σ merely un-biased upward.
**Canonical run** (all three node exports — ECGDex+PpgDex+**OxyDex**, using both node `motionIndex`) landed in the
**quiet-order / negative-variance** regime (H10↔OxyDex r=0.90): classic drove the smoothed OxyDex σ to a
pathological **0.03 bpm**, and the **real measured co-motion ρ=0.655** (Verity↔OxyDex) **RESCUED it to 1.02 bpm**
— the first end-to-end evidence on real data that a motion-derived ρ corrects the quiet-order under-estimate the
reference-free path cannot (the `_tchRhoFromMotion` design intent). **Mechanism ✓ + rescue ✓.** (My earlier
"over-subtracts" reading was analytically WRONG — classic UNDER-estimates under positive common-mode; ρ un-biases
upward.) **Still open:** a distribution + reference-anchored magnitude check — more trio nights (each just the
three tiny node-export JSONs, as here); no raw-ACC ingest needed.

`_tchRhoFromMotion` is a **proxy** (co-motion correlation stands in for the shared motion-driven noise the
reference-free estimator can't recover), validated only synthetically by the golden. **Blocked on a real
co-recorded O2Ring + Polar H10 + Verity Sense night** (the repo holds none — the equiv fixtures are different
nights/durations). When one is captured: confirm the motion-derived ρ actually *reduces* cross-device HR
divergence vs classic; confirm OxyDex `motionIndex` (O2Ring accel count) and PpgDex `motionIndex` (optical
index) genuinely co-vary positively under real co-motion (different scales — correlation is scale-invariant,
but verify not anti-/un-correlated by construction); consider z-scoring per-node motion before correlating and
a minimum aligned-motion overlap `n` before trusting ρ. **Validation write-up (`papers/` or `docs/`), not a gate.**

**UPDATE 2026-07-10 — reproducible multi-night harness landed (`tools/tch-multinight.mjs`).** The §5/§6
runs were ad-hoc on off-repo files; they are now a committed, deterministic Node tool that runs the
classic-vs-per-night-motion-ρ A/B across N nights through the shipped `IntegratorTCH` kernel (mirroring
`_tchRhoFromMotion`). `--selftest` reproduces the §6 rescue as a **known-answer distribution** on a
planted-correlation synthetic corpus (6 nights, both regimes, 30/30 checks green: culprit = planted-loudest
every night; culprit σ within ×1.6/×2 of planted; the 3 quiet-order nights drive classic OxyDex σ ≈0 and
the motion-ρ rescues it; median culprit σ 3.06 ≈ the real corpus's 2.8). `--dir <path>` ingests real trio
node-export triples (the §6 input contract) via the identical path. So the **remaining owed work is DATA,
not code** — commit ≥~5 more nights' three node-export JSONs and `--dir` prints the real distribution. A
subtlety surfaced (docs §7): the mean-of-all-pairs ρ dilutes when only one pair is tightly coupled, so a
coupled-pair-weighted ρ is a candidate `_tchRhoFromMotion` refinement if the real distribution confirms it.
Write-up: `docs/INTEGRATOR-TCH-REALDATA-VALIDATION-2026-07-06.md` §7.

**UPDATE 2026-07-11 — literature-anchored magnitude check PASSES (docs §8).** The reference-anchored leg now
has a second, independent anchor beyond committed trio nights: published wearable-HR validation vs gold-standard
ECG. Our reference-free σ̂ (Verity 2.8 / O2Ring 1.4 / H10 0.9 bpm) matches both the **ranking** (H10 = the
criterion device → most accurate; arm/finger PPG next) and the **order of magnitude** (Polar Verity Sense
upper-arm MAE 1.43 bpm → σ-equiv ≈1.8 via σ=MAE·√(π/2); Schweizer & Gilgen-Ammann 2025, JMIR Cardio
`10.2196/67110`). MAE≠σ and it's a single external anchor, so this does NOT retire the committed-trio
distribution — but it confirms 2.8 bpm is a physically plausible arm-PPG σ. Details + citations in docs §8.

**CLOSED 2026-07-13 — the committed-trio distribution landed (docs §11).** With 17 trio nights now committed,
`node tools/tch-multinight.mjs --dir uploads/trio` produced the owed distribution through the shipped kernel:
**17/17 nights solve**; median σ **ECGDex 0.95 / OxyDex 1.19 / PpgDex 1.85 bpm**, preserving the ranking (the
criterion H10 is the quietest corner) and landing the Verity corner on §8's independent literature anchor (≈1.8)
— so the **magnitude check passes on both anchors** and §1's "distribution + reference-anchored magnitude" ask is
met. The rescue reproduced (quiet-order on 7/17 nights; motion-ρ rescued 4, incl. the §6 night at OxyDex σ
0.04 → 1.00 bpm). **The 3 failures are the payload:** ρ_motion (0.04–0.39) fell *short* of the ρ the geometry
requires (0.59–0.69), so `threeCorneredHat` (`integrator-tch.js:275`) fell through the `correlated-external`
branch into the auto min-ρ search — which is boundary-seeking and therefore pins the quiet corner at ≈0 *by
construction*. This **confirms the §7 dilution hypothesis** (mean-of-positive-pairwise-ρ under-reads exactly in
the quiet-order shape) and promotes the **coupled-pair-weighted ρ** from candidate to **indicated** → carried to
`INTEGRATOR-THREE-CORNERED-HAT-FOLLOWUPS-IV-2026-07-13-BRIEF.md` §1. Analysis-only: no runtime code, bundle,
`manifestHash`, or fixture moved.

## §2 — a real-signal (not in-code) golden variant, once a synth raw-ECG generator exists 🟢 (LOW) — RE-DEFERRED 2026-07-13 → FU-IV §2
The §2 golden rebuilds its three inputs **in-code** (the `cpapdex_synthetic_golden` precedent) — deliberately, so
it gates on Integrator code alone. The heavier "run each node's real `compute()` on co-recorded raw streams"
path (FU-II §2 Approach B) was NOT taken because (a) no synthetic **raw-ECG** generator exists (`synth-gen.js`
emits RR/PPG/O2Ring, not 130 Hz ECG µV) and (b) a ≥60-min 176 Hz PPG set is tens of MB. If a synth raw-ECG
generator lands (or a real co-recorded night arrives, cf §1), a SECOND golden produced by three real node
computes would additionally pin the node→Integrator seam end-to-end. Optional; the in-code golden already closes
the "fusion has no code-gated fixture" hole.

## §3 — a classic-solve (ρ-null) golden leg for σ² magnitude recovery 🟢 (LOW) — RE-DEFERRED 2026-07-13 → FU-IV §2
The committed golden's `correlated-external` solve (ρ=0.356) recovers the culprit ORDER (OxyDex noisiest) but
**compresses** the σ² magnitudes (planted {1, 4.8, 20} → recovered {7.2, 11.6, 12.5}) — inherent to the
common-mode subtraction. A second in-code golden with **uncorrelated** motion (→ ρ null → classic solve) would
pin the near-exact magnitude recovery {≈1, ≈4.8, ≈20} as a complementary reference. Cheap, additive, Integrator-
local — but low value (the estimator's magnitude recovery is already unit-gated by `5e`/`5f`). Do only if a
magnitude-pinned golden is wanted.

## §4 — N-cornered hat (3 → N sensors), from FU-I §4 [blocked] 🟡 — EXPLICITLY RE-DEFERRED 2026-07-13 → FU-IV §3
> **Re-deferral (2026-07-13, the condition this brief's DONE stamp required).** §4 is **not** executed and is
> **not** dropped: it remains blocked on the same two unmet preconditions — a real **≥4-sensor co-recording** and
> **EEGDex shipping** (`EEGDEX-BUILD-BRIEF.md`) — neither of which moved. Nothing learned in §1's real-data run
> changes that (docs §10 reinforces it: ML-TCH's advantages only materialize at N≥4). The section is carried
> **verbatim** to `INTEGRATOR-THREE-CORNERED-HAT-FOLLOWUPS-IV-2026-07-13-BRIEF.md` §3 so it survives this DONE
> stamp, exactly as FU-I §4 survived FU-I's.
The estimator is fixed at THREE sensors (classic Gray–Allan closed form). **Blocked on** a real ≥4-sensor
co-recording (a 2nd PPG site / a second Verity / a Muse S PPG channel) AND, for the EEGDex corner, on **EEGDex
shipping** (`EEGDEX-BUILD-BRIEF.md`). When unblocked: add a sibling `nCorneredHat(seriesList, opts)` (least-
squares over all pairwise AVARs → per-sensor σ² + inverse-var weights + culprit + a covariance-ρ matrix;
Ekström–Koppang / Premoli–Tavella), have `_tchHat` pick the estimator by sensor count, keep the N=3 closed form
byte-identical. Additive. (Verbatim from FU-I §4 — recorded here so it survives FU-I's DONE stamp.)

**Literature note (2026-07-11 sweep — see docs §9).** The N-cornered least-squares form is confirmed by Schatzman
2020/2021. More usefully, the sweep found **principled fixes for the negative-variance / quiet-order regime** the
current `correlated` min-ρ clamp only *flags*: a **maximum-likelihood TCH** (non-negative by construction + gives
per-estimate uncertainties via bootstrap; Schatzman 2020) and the **Groslambert / two-sample covariance** (GCOV;
Vernotte–Calosso–Rubiola), which converges without the equal-noise hypothesis and **outperforms TCH** on exactly
the negative-variance case (Calosso 2018). This is a **candidate estimator upgrade** (its own future brief — it
changes `integrator-tch.js` and regenerates the golden), independent of §4's N-sensor extension. Cross-domain
precedent for the whole reference-free approach: Sjoberg 2021 applies 3CH to atmospheric datasets with the same
unknown-error-correlation limitation (related-work anchor for `SENSOR-TRIO-NIGHTS-PAPER`).

## Ordering & dependency
**Updated 2026-07-06:** §1's **premise leg is DONE** (real corpus validated the motion-driven-divergence +
quiet-order regime + σ recovery — see the docs write-up). What's left: §1's **end-to-end ρ-vs-classic A/B**
(runnable NOW — feed the 10 clean nights' node exports through `fuseHRVConsensus` with ρ on/off; no longer
blocked); §2 + §3 are LOW optional polish on the already-gated golden; §4 (N-cornered) remains blocked on
EEGDex / a ≥4-sensor co-recording. Flip this brief to DONE once the §1 A/B lands (or is consciously dropped)
and §4 is either executed or explicitly re-deferred.

**SATISFIED 2026-07-13 → DONE.** §1's A/B **landed** on the 17 committed trio nights (docs §11), and §4 is
**explicitly re-deferred** above (both preconditions still unmet) — the two stated conditions, met. §2/§3 stay
LOW-optional and ride to FU-IV with §4. The one genuinely new finding — the confirmed ρ-dilution, which makes
the coupled-pair-weighted `_tchRhoFromMotion` an *indicated* change rather than a speculative one — is the
follow-up brief's headline.

## Scope guard
Integrator-local + additive when eventually executed. Must NOT touch the shared `parseTimestamp` (Clock-Contract
parser), the Ganglior event schema / `fascia` alias, or re-ingest raw streams (`INTEGRATOR-BUILD-BRIEF.md` §0).
Keep the N=3 path (and the committed golden) byte-identical; any deliberate fusion-shape change REQUIRES
regenerating `uploads/integrator_tch_golden.node-export.json` + re-recording its GATE-B triple.
