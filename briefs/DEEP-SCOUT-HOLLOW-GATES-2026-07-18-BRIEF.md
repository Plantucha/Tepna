# Deep-scout hollow-gate wave — findings ledger (40 NEW hollow gates)

Executes `TEST-AUDIT-FINDINGS-FOLLOWUPS-2026-07-18-BRIEF.md` **§3** (the deep-scout second wave). The
first audit planted a fixed 99 mutations; this wave planted **fresh** mutations in the *under-covered*
clusters the 99 never probed, ran each against the **full suite WITH the real corpus**
(`DEX_UPLOADS=…/uploads` — the equiv/GATE-C legs boot), and recorded a gate as **hollow** only when it
stayed green under a real, behavior-changing defect (semantic no-ops rejected; every finding reverted,
tree left clean). Orchestrated as an 8-cluster `Workflow` of worktree-isolated scout agents.

**Result: 40 confirmed NEW hollow gates** (3 high, 30 medium, 7 low) across 5 clusters. Three clusters
(**render**, **self-ingest**, **gluco-cpap-oxy-deep**) returned nothing — their scout agents died on the
session rate-limit before reporting, so those are **NOT cleared, only un-scanned** (see §Re-scout).

The first-wave total was 40; the **re-scout of the 3 dead clusters (2026-07-18) added 14 more → 54 total**.

**Tally: 36 of 54 closed** (crossnight 8 + kernel 8 + integrator 8 + ecg-ppg 2 + self-ingest 3 + gluco 4 +
render 3), all both-direction verified and merged. Remaining 18: 7 ecg-ppg call-site/narrow-band, 7
adapters, 4 render (the node render-execution harness is now BUILT — PR #187 — and closed the 3 HIGH gates;
the 4 remaining are inline in non-reviewView/reRender/canvas paths). See
`DEEP-SCOUT-HOLLOW-GATES-FOLLOWUPS-2026-07-18-BRIEF.md`.

## §CN — crossnight-deep (8) — **DONE 2026-07-18, PR #173**

The `Cross §1 — per-node crossNightBlock` group pinned only `central.sd`/baseline (wave-1) and
labels/evidence. Every **other surfaced cross-night estimator** was hollow, and because each `*-cross.js`
carries its **own copy** of `median`/`quantile`/`ols`/`mannKendall`, a defect in any one node escaped.
Closed with **22 known-answer pins** across all 5 nodes (OxyDex `meanSpo2`, PulseDex/PpgDex/ECGDex
`rmssd`, CPAPDex `usageHours`+`residualAHI` on a non-degenerate falling series): `central.median`,
`central.iqr`, `min`, `max`, `trend.slopePerDay`, `trend.mannKendall.tau`/`.p`. Both-direction verified
(median even-n collapse, IQR interp break, Mann-Kendall S sign-flip each RED their node's pin). Full
corpus suite green **2886 · 2 skipped**.

## §AD — adapters (7) — OPEN

The raw→SignalFrame→compute boundary. **Off-suite harness owed** (some of these need a small
adapter-level driver, harder than the sync test lane).

## §IF — integrator-fusion (8) — **DONE 2026-07-18, PR #180**

Fusion internals beyond the first wave. Two are **high** (verdict-flipping). All 8 closed with
both-direction-verified known-answers reached through already-wired `env` entry points
(`fuseHRVConsensus`/`runFusion`/`normalizeFile`/`labelPositionalApnea`/`fusePeriodicBreathing`/
`IntegratorTCH`) — no `run-tests.mjs` change. #4/#5 use two distinct scenarios so each is caught
independently. Full corpus suite green (2883). Each mutation re-applied + confirmed RED.

## §KR — kernel-registry (8) — **DONE 2026-07-18, PR #175**

**Derived** panel. All 8 closed with boundary-bracketing known-answers in the `Dex-Profile engine`

## §EP — ecg-ppg-detect-deep (9) — **2/9 DONE 2026-07-18, PR #177; 7 OPEN**

Spectral/nonlinear detector internals. Every spectral gate in the suite checked `lombScargle`/`dfaAlpha1`
by **source regex** (structural) — blind to a numeric edge/range change. **CLOSED (PR #177)** with
value-based known-answers reached through the exported `ECGDSP.lombScargle`/`dfaAlpha1`: the **LF/HF band
edge 0.15 Hz** (a 0.13 Hz RR oscillation lands in LF; a 0.12 shift moves it to HF — frac_lf 0.988→0.024)
and the **DFA box range 4..16** (fixed seeded series → α1 0.649; an n≤11 truncation → 0.751). The other 7
are call-site tolerances or narrow-band cases that a pure-function pin can't reach — they need the
`analyze` pipeline or a fuller (non-"light") equiv fixture: SampEn `0.2·SD` and PRSA `/4` are applied
inside `analyze` (not args to the exported fn), the EDR autocorr window likewise; the PPG VLF/LF 0.04 edge
is leakage-limited (VLF band 0.003–0.04 is too narrow for a clean single-tone RR probe). **OPEN:**

## §Re-scout — the three clusters whose agents died — **RAN 2026-07-18**

**render**, **self-ingest**, **gluco-cpap-oxy-deep** reported **0** in the first wave only because their
scout agents were killed by the rate-limit. Re-run 2026-07-18 (3 parallel worktree-isolated scouts,
corpus baseline 2937): **14 NEW hollow gates**, three distinct classes.

### §SI — self-ingest (3 → **DONE, PR #183**)
Each node's `loadOwnExport` returns **top-level convenience accessors** (`res.hrv`/`summary`/`recording`/
`generated`) that the DOM review renderers consume, but the node-lane self-ingest gates asserted only
`res.elements[0].*` — so dropping a top-level accessor (`hrv: json.hrv||null`→`null`) blanks the review
panel yet stays green (only the browser render-coverage probe drives the renderers). ECGDex+PpgDex already
pinned them; closed the other 5 node gates (PulseDex HIGH `res.hrv`; GlucoDex MED `res.recording`; Oxy/
CPAP/HRV `res.recording`/`res.generated`). Both-direction verified; suite 2944.

### §GV — GlucoDex unexported variability indices (4 → **DONE, PR #184**)
`variability()` computes **jIndex · CONGA-1/2/4 · GRADE · MAG** — surfaced as KPI tiles/table rows — but
`glucoBuildNodeExport`'s `glucose{}` block **omits the whole family**, so the Phase-9 equiv gate (the only
value-pinning gate) is blind and no unit test asserted them. Four slips shipped green (jIndex `mean+SD→
mean−SD`, CONGA lag `·60→·30`, GRADE zone `140→180`, MAG `abs()`-removal). Closed with 6 direct
`analyze()` known-answers on a deterministic sinusoid. **OxyDex + CPAPDex re-scouted and confirmed
well-covered** (both byte-pin their full metric trees via equiv/golden — control probes caught).

### §RN — render layer NOT executed in the node lane (7 → **OPEN, STRUCTURAL — see follow-up**)
The heavy one. `run-tests.mjs` loads every `*-render.js` **only as raw text into `env.sources`** — the
render modules are **never executed** in the node/corpus lane. So NO value assertion can pin any surfaced
render output; the only render defects the node gate catches are those that alter a *literal a source-text
grep happens to check* (mmol edge labels, the `_GLU_MMOL` constant, badge-CSS parity, null-safety regexes).
Seven planted defects all shipped green, including three severe surfaced-value breaks:

| sev | file · invariant | mutation that stayed green |
|--|--|--|
| high | `glucodex-render.js` `GluDisp.val` mg/dL→mmol = ÷18.018 | `÷ → ×` (≈325× wrong glucose in mmol mode) |
| high | `oxydex-render.js` mean-SpO₂ KPI color ok≥95/warn≥92 | `≥95/≥92 → ≥85/≥82` (hypoxic 88% painted green) |
| high | `cpapdex-render.js` residual-AHI band <5/<15/<30 | `<5 → <50` ("well controlled" on AHI 40) |
| medium | `oxydex-render.js` SpO₂ Night CV = (SD/mean)·**100** | `·100 → ·10` (hero number 10× low) |
| medium | `hrvdex-render.js` rMSSD KPI color >35/>20 | `>35/>20 → >65/>50` (healthy 45 ms painted bad) |
| medium | `pulsedex-render.js` DUPLICATED Tanaka HRmax `208−0.7·age` | `0.7 → 0.9` (its own copy drifts from ECGProfile) |
| low | `ecgdex-render.js` waveform minute-tick `t/60` | `t/60 → t/30` (axis labels 2×) |

This is **not** closeable in the node lane — it needs either (a) the **browser render-coverage lane**
(`Dex-Test-Suite.html?full`) wired into the merge/CI gate so it actually asserts rendered values, or (b) a
**node-lane render-execution harness** that instantiates the render builders against a stub DOM and pins
their output. That is test-infrastructure work, not a per-finding assertion → spun into
`DEEP-SCOUT-HOLLOW-GATES-FOLLOWUPS-2026-07-18-BRIEF.md`.

## Done when

Each OPEN cluster is either gated (a both-direction-verified assertion per finding, PASS clean + RED
under the exact mutation) or explicitly dispositioned in a further follow-up; the three dead clusters have
been re-scouted; and this brief flips to `DONE`. Land each cluster as its own gated PR (crossnight-deep =
PR #173 already). Prioritize the two **high** integrator verdict-flips (§IF) and the ecg-ppg spectral
band edges (§EP) — those move surfaced clinical numbers.
