# PER-NIGHT QC SUMMARY. "Did last night actually capture?" used to mean opening files by hand. This walks
# a night directory and answers it at a glance: per configured (device, stream), how many rows landed, and
# which expected streams produced NOTHING — the header-only files a rejected PMD START or a never-worn
# sensor leaves behind. Surfaced in status.json (`qc`) and written as <night>/QC-SUMMARY.json.
#
# Pure + cheap: it reads filenames and counts newlines, no vendor-format parsing. Capture files are the
# writers.capture_filename() layout — `<vendor>_<model>_<deviceid>_<YYYYMMDDHHMMSS>_<STREAM>.<ext>` — and
# every writer emits exactly one header line, so rows = newlines − 1.

# and measuring a stream that is streaming perfectly RIGHT NOW against that ~19 h wall-clock span reads it as
# ~0 % (a false 'degraded', the very inversion of the false-confidence bug coverage exists to catch). One hour
# comfortably spans reconnect churn / a bathroom break (kept in one session) but splits a genuine new sitting.
