"""The DECISION LOGIC behind `tools/mutate_diff.py`, split out so it sits inside the coverage floor.

WHY IT LIVES HERE AND NOT IN tools/. Identical reasoning to `mutation_triage.py`, and the same house
rule: `tools/` is outside the coverage denominator until something imports it, which is fine for
`git`/`subprocess`/`argparse`/IO and NOT fine for logic that can return a WRONG ANSWER instead of
failing loudly. These functions decide what the diff-scoped mutation gate IGNORES, and a wrong bucket
does harm in both directions — it hides a real survivor, or it manufactures a false refutation.

🔴 THIS IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL; IT ALREADY HAPPENED, AND IT IS WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `is_string_only`
used to ask whether the added line CONTAINED a quote — a different question, which gave the wrong
answer. Measured 2026-08-24: two identical `encoding="utf-8" → encoding=None` mutations were handled
oppositely because one line carried an unrelated `"mutants"` path segment. The skipped one then came
back REFUTED, and REFUTED's documented remedy is to DELETE the entry — so the gate was manufacturing
false refutations and instructing a reader to destroy a correct classification. It sat in `tools/`,
unmeasured, with a `--selftest` that no gate invoked.

⚠️ A SELFTEST IS NOT THE FLOOR. `--selftest` covers what its author thought to test; the floor covers
what they did not, which is where a wrong answer lives by definition. The selftest moved here with the
logic and is now driven by a test, so it runs on every push rather than only when a human types it.

PREDICTIVE SCREEN, measured 4/4 on 2026-08-27 across the four unimported tools: **if a file under
`tools/` imports `ast` or `re`, suspect decision logic and look.** It turns the mislead-criterion from
a judgement into a grep, which is its whole value — but it is a SCREEN, NOT A PROOF, and this very
file is the counter-example that bounds it:

  · `ast` is the strong half. Parsing source STRUCTURE is almost always deciding something.
  · `re` is the weak half. After this split `tools/mutate_diff.py` STILL imports `re` — for the git
    hunk-header pattern and for finding function names in a mutmut-generated file. That is parsing an
    external tool's output format, which is plumbing that legitimately needs a regex.

So a hit means LOOK, not MOVE. Reported as 4/4 predictive on first use; recording the bound here so the
next reader does not treat a screen as a verdict.

    Requiring these killed means asserting on message text, which makes a suite brittle without making
    it more truthful. 29 of 33 survivors on capture.py's `_now` were exactly this.

    🔴 THIS USED TO ASK WHETHER THE LINE *CONTAINED* A QUOTE, WHICH IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION AND GAVE
    THE WRONG ANSWER. The old body was
        `all(("XX" in ln) or ('"' in ln) or ("'" in ln) for ln in added)`
    so ANY mutation on a line holding ANY string literal — a path segment, a dict key, an f-string —

        read_text(encoding="utf-8") → encoding=None
          line 53:  `data = json.loads(Path(meta_path).read_text(…))`      no quote → REPORTED
          line 95:  `src  = (Path(work) / "mutants" / module).read_text(…)`  quote → SKIPPED

    Same mutation, opposite handling, decided by the unrelated literal `"mutants"` elsewhere on the
    line. ⚠️ And the consequence was worse than hiding a survivor: `classify` reads *generated but
    absent from survivors* as KILLED, so a ledgered equivalence on such a line came back **REFUTED**
    — whose documented remedy is to delete the entry. The gate was manufacturing false refutations
    and instructing the reader to destroy a correct classification.

    ⚠️ Keying on mutmut's `XX` sentinel alone is the tempting fix and is ALSO wrong — it is too
    narrow. `"utf-8" → "UTF-8"` is a genuine string-literal mutation carrying no sentinel, and would
    start being required.

    empty, and the run prints "every mutant on the changed functions was killed" with
    `survivors: []`. That is a GREEN VERDICT ABOUT ZERO MUTANTS — the check reporting success
    about something it never examined, the same shape as a `-k` filter that matches nothing or
    a `pytest` line without `--cov`. Recorded in PAT-OFFSET-ESTIMATOR-FOLLOWUPS.

    Pure on purpose: the caller gathers the two facts, this decides. That keeps the decision
